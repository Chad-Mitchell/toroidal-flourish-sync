# Changelog: Toroidal Flourish Sync

## v3.0 (Nov 09, 2025): Fractal Regime Push
- 10x breadth/depth: 72 blades clustered (individual/dyad/community scales).
- Regime align: Weak irr 70%, strong rat 30%, hybrids K>1.2 (MI +15-25%).
- Audit prune: Rational broad (not quantum-only—neural/social too); equilibrium: Irr frequent, rat bulk at thresholds.
- Effort-min: YAML modular, sim_fractal.py for probes.
- Conjecture guide: Frequent hetero updates until K>1.2 (this push as equilibrium).

Prior: v2.1 (substance regimes), v2.0 (yoga/tune band), v1.3 (spectral).
